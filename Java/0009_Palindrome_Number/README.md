# 9. Palindrome Number
  
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.  
  
  
### **Example 1:**  
Input: ```x = 121```  
Output: ```true```  
Explanation: _121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left._  
  
### **Example 2:**  
Input: ```x = -121```  
Output: ```false```  
Explanation: _From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome._  
  
### **Example 3:**  
Input: ```x = 10```  
Output: ```false```  
Explanation: _Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome._  
   
  
### **Constraints:**  
  
```-231 <= x <= 231 - 1```
